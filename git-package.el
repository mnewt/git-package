;;; Commentary:

;; Git Package is a package manager that uses git and runs asynchronously.

;; This file includes the minimum functionality necessary to load packages that
;; have already been installed.  That way, on startup, we don't do any
;; unnecessary work.

;; For more information, see [[file:README.org]].
