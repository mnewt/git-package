*** DONE Resolve package names properly
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-01-05 Sun 08:35]
*** DONE Add =git-package--find-elpa-recipe=

    - State "DONE"       from "WIP"        [2020-01-05 Sun 08:33]
*** DONE Add variable =git-package-dependency-ensure-method=
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-01-05 Sun 08:39]
Value is ='git-package= or ='package=.

*** DONE Add variable =git-package-use-package-always-ensure=

    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-01-05 Sun 08:39]
*** DONE Resolve deps using our own algorithm, not =package.el=
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-01-05 Sun 08:41]
    Always resolve deps using our own algorithm because =package.el='s breaks if there is no "Version" string. However, by default we should probably still install deps using =package.el=. The reasoning is that is probably what people expect.

*** DONE Add =git-package--emacsmirror-recipe=

    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-01-05 Sun 09:19]
